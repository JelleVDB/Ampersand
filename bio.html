        <p>The idea of starting to make music came to Sven and Daan at Feest in het Park 2010. They didn't really know each other, but had mutual friends.
            Sven already knew how to play guitar and had been playing for a couple of years.
            Only living one street away from each other ment that their first rehearsal didn't took long.</p>

        <p>At that point, Daan did not have a guitar and definitly did not know how to play.
            From that point on it got serious, we got a band and we were searching for a name, which resulted in Ampersand.</p>

        <p>The first gig, 25 jaar Lietoziekla, came earlier then expected. But as Daan had just ordered his guitar and since they had received a deadline,
            this meant that Daan had to learn how to play the guitar in 3 weeks and they had to learn some songs.</p>

        <p>On the first gigs they played acoustic sets and a variety of covers.</p>

        <p>The first rehearsel with the entire band took place on May 12, 2012.
            Daan and Sven decided to meet with Thomas, a very talented bass player, and Nikki,
            a colleague of Sven and former drummer of The Candidates for President who knew the tricks of the trade.
            The rehearsel blasted off with a cover of Coldplay’s ‘Yellow’. As soon as the band started playing,
            there was a certain connection and everybody realised this was the start of something new: with Nikki on the drums and Thomas on the bass,
            Ampersand was fully armed to compete with other bands in Oudenaarde.</p>

        <p>It didn’t take long before Ampersand got their first gig on the first of September: Ijzerrock.
            With the deadline in mind, the band quickly developed a repertoire of 10 cover songs.</p>

        <p>After that, the band decided to produce their own music.
            While performing at local gigs and keeping up the repertoire, the group members found time to write songs themselves.</p>

        <p>They were inspired by a wide range of legendary artists including The Beatles, U2, Coldplay and many more.
            Along with these selfwritten songs, Ampersand started to create their own sound, based on Daan’s warm voice and several guitar effects.</p>
